      Talking to Friends About Your Own Self Image:
      <p>When talking to friends about your self image, they should respond positively. Friends should not pressure you into doing anything 
      wrong or dangerous. True friendship is seeing the beauty in eachother. If a friend puts you down in any way or pressures you into doing 
      something you don't want to do, you should tell them to stop. If they don't stop then they aren't good to be around! The truth is, you are 
      beautiful and if anyone treats you differently then they are wrong. As long as you are nice to others and are healthy, it doesn't matter 
      what body type you have and everyone should know this.</p>

    Talking to Friends About Their Self Image:
      <p>Talking about sensitive topics like self image can be difficult to not hurt someone. A friend with low self-esteem may suffer from 
      depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, or something of the sort. If a friend chooses to open up to you about it, let them know that they 
      are loved and keep in mind that it took a lot of courage for them to confide in you. As for your friends who don't have low self-esteem, 
      let them know how much you care also. It is important to let people know that you care about them, and to be as nice and as loving as possible. If everyone is nice to each other, it makes a better, happier world without low self-esteem.</p>
